### Building genome sequences relations graph from DNA/RNA reads
_Educational project in bioinformatics_

All C++ code is built using [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ "GNU make").
Presentation slides are built using XeLaTeX.

**pair_read_graph** uses [SeqAn library](https://www.seqan.de "SeqAn").

**rna_graph** uses [NetworkX](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/networkx/1.11 "NetworkX") and [PyDotPlus](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydotplus "PyDotPlus") packages. It is also required that its input is generated using **show-coords** with flags **-THql**.
